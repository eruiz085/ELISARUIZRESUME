        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business ManagementðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a first year student at the University of California, Riverside. I am currently taking Pre-Business, planning to major in Business with a concentration in management or administration. I am almost a quarter ahead.I am dorming here, in the East Lothian Building, getting the full college experience and obtaining networking experience.  <br><br>

        I have previous experience, including in jobs that required good customer service, planning ahead, patience, and being knowledgeable of resources. Starting with my most recent position, which I am currently in, I am a Student Assistant at the Information Desk in the Rivera Library here at UC Riverside. This job entails helping patrons not only with basic reference or information questions, but also with any research questions they may have, such as where to find academic journals, how to access the library catalog, which databases to use, etcetera. I have been in this position for almost half a year now.I got my research knowledge not just from my training at my job here, but also because I had a research internship the previous summer, with the Upward Bound student program. This was an amazing opportunity I was given to learn more about how to conduct research, and what tools are available to me. I was in this position for a few months in the summerI also participated in another internship previously; a student internship with the  non profit organization Homework House in my hometown. In this job I was required to be a Teacherâ€™s Assistant to a class of children ages 3-4, in preschool. It required a lot of patience, organizational, and planning skills. I was in this position for a few months in the summer as well. Adding onto my work experience is an ongoing/on and off job I have at the moment is also the place where I acquired the most customer service skills; a Cashier position in a restaurant. This is a typical job, where one helps to serve customers ordering food. It sounds like an easy position, until you actually experience dealing with customers firsthand in these kinds of service jobs. This job entailed taking customersâ€™ orders, serving drinks, as well as maintaining the cleanliness of the restaurant. I have experience in this position for almost three years now, seeing as it is a family business that I am supporting. This of course was a driving factors in my doing so well in the position, and striving to always do my best, which I think definitely helped me build the most skills possible in this position.  <br><br>

        I hope to acquire even more work experience in the near future, obviously, but hopefully it is in a position closer to the field I am learning about in university, and can help me reach my professional potential. I plan to join a position in the headquarters of the family business I work right now as a cashier, and hopefully broaden the horizons of the business, and help it expand successfully. We will see what the future may bring.
